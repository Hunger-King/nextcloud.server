"This application enables users to restore files that were deleted from the "
"system. It displays a list of deleted files in the web interface, and has "
"options to restore those deleted files back to the users file directories or "
"remove them permanently from the system. Restoring a file also restores "
"related file versions, if the versions application is enabled. When a file "
"is deleted from a share, it can be restored in the same manner, though it is "
"no longer shared. By default, these files remain in the trash bin for 30 "
"days.\n"
"To prevent a user from running out of disk space, the Deleted files app will "
"not utilize more than 50% of the currently available free quota for deleted "
"files. If the deleted files exceed this limit, the app deletes the oldest "
"files until it gets below this limit. More information is available in the "
"Deleted Files documentation."
